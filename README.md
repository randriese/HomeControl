# HomeControl
Inspired by the very useful LUA-Pass2PHP for Domoticz by Egregius (https://github.com/Egregius/LUA-Pass2PHP-for-Domoticz)

#Why HomeControl
Domoticz is a very powerful Domotic application which allows complete control of your devices. However, when you have a lot of devices it can become quite slow in processing all the scripts. By passing all the data to an external script, you can have more control and faster response times.

Plan is to also add a front-end to this tool
